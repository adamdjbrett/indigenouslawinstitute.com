# Indigenous Law Institute

## Introduction

The Indigenous Law Institute assists American Indian and other Indigenous communities to work toward a future of restoration and healing.

## Mission Statement

The Indigenous Law Institute is dedicated to supporting Indigenous nations and peoples to protect their sacred ancestral homelands, to restore and revitalize their linguistic, cultural, and spiritual traditions, and to heal from the trauma of colonization.

## Foundational Summary

Over the course of the past five centuries, the American Indian nations of the Western Hemisphere, and Indigenous nations from other parts of the world have been forced to live under imposed patterns of empire and domination.

## Traditional Native Law

At the time of the so-called Christian European "discovery" of the Indian lands of the Western Hemisphere, our respective Native nations and peoples lived a completely free and independent spiritual way of life.

## The Empire-Domination Model

On May 4, 1493, Pope Alexander VI issued a papal document known as the bull _Inter Caetera_. The document purported to "give" to the two Catholic monarchs all the lands which Cristobal Colon (Columbus) had "discovered."

## Historical Unresolved Grief Seminars

Having suffered generations of trauma and abuse at the hands of the empire-builders, Native nations and peoples now suffer from a great deal of dysfunctional behavior.
