Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) reads: "All peoples have the right of self-determination."

## ARTICLE 3 OF THE UN DRAFT DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES

Article 3 of the UN Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was lifted directly from Article 1 of both the ICCPR and the ICESCR.

## THE "INDIGENOUS PROBLEM" IS A COLONIAL PROBLEM

According to Fact Sheet No. 9, "The Rights of Indigenous Peoples," indigenous peoples are so-called because they were living on their lands before settlers came from elsewhere.
