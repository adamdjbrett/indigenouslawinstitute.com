## Introduction

We, the People of the Oceti Sakowin, have existed rightfully free and independent since the beginning of time. As a sovereign Nation, we are, and forever shall be, rightfully free and independent.

The purpose of an Oglala Lakota Constitution is Wolakota, a spiritual way of life, based on the Seven Laws that were handed to our People by the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe Woman.

Four key Elements of Life provide the very basis of our Life as a Nation: makoce (earth, land, matter), mni (water, movement, liquid sustenance), peta (fire, lightning, laser energy), oniye (air, breath).

## Four Elements of Life Provide the Basis of Self-Government

### Makoce (Land)
### Mni (water, movement)
### Peta (Fire, energy, lightning)
### Oniye (Air, breath, oxygen)

## The Lakota Language Provides the Basis for a Constitution

## Oglala Lakota Bi-Cameral Government Structure (Proposed in 1977 by Birgil Kills Straight)

### Woope Sakowin (Seven Laws)

1. Wacante Oganake, "To help, to share, to give, to be generous."
2. Wowaunsila, "Pity, Compassion."
3. Wowauonihan, "To Respect, to Honor."
4. Wowacintanka, "Patience and Tolerance."
5. Wowahwala, "To be Humble, To Seek Humility."
6. Woohitike, "To be Guided By Your Principles, Disciplined, Bravery and Courage."
7. Woksape, "Understanding and Wisdom."

## Conclusion

Representing the Indigenous Law Institute, we have created this document in order to study and to comment on the issue of a proposed Oglala Lakota Constitution.
