# PERSPECTIVES
## Healing, Restoration, and Rematriation

### by Steven Newcomb, Shawnee/Lenape
Executive Director, Indigenous Law Institute

For Native nations and peoples, being able to live our traditions means fulfilling our sacred responsibilities to the Earth, to our communities, and to all living things. This necessarily involves the ability to maintain and to pass on to every new generation the languages, ceremonies, customs, and laws of our respective peoples.

Today, repatriation efforts are aimed at assisting our communities to heal from generations of genocide and cultural devastation. But, if "repatriation" involves a "return of prisoners of war to their home country," and is a term used to refer to skeletal remains and sacred ceremonial objects, what term do we use to refer to the "home countries" that are themselves, in many cases, now being "held captive" by the United States?

By "rematriation" I mean "to restore a living culture to its rightful place on Mother Earth," or "to restore a people to a spiritual way of life, in sacred relationship with their ancestral lands, without external interference."
