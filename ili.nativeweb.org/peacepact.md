## The Pu'uhonua Peace Pact
### A Declaration of Vision from the Cultural and Spiritual Perspectives of Indigenous Peoples

## Introduction

We, as representatives of the Indigenous Law Institute, the Kanaka Maoli Tribunal Komike, and the Fourth World Center for the Study of Indigenous Law and Politics, welcome the opportunity presented by the Hague Appeal for Peace to help create a new paradigm of peace.

## Original Independence, Indigenous Cultures of Peace, and Self-Determination

Originally, Indigenous nations and peoples were entirely free and independent, inherently and naturally self-determining throughout time.

## The Basic Foundations of Colonialism, International Law, and U.S. Indian Law

More than five centuries ago, in the earliest known example of globalization, the European nations of Western Christendom began to conquer other parts of the world.

## Remedies and Recommendations

That the world community call upon Pope John Paul II, and the Vatican, to formally revoke the Inter Cetera bull of May 4,1493.
