# Comment: Pope Asks Forgiveness - Will The Vatican Repeal The Inter Cetera?

This past Sunday, March 12, 2000, Pope John Paul II begged God to forgive the sins of the "sons and daughters" of the Church. His goal is "purification of memory" by expressing sorrow for misdeeds committed by Christians over the past 2,000 years.

Since 1992, we at the Indigenous Law Institute have been working to publicize the truth about the history of the Inter Cetera papal bull, delivered by Pope Alexander VI on May 4, 1493. This document expressed the pope's earnest desire that "barbarous nations be subjugated and brought to the faith itself," "for the spread of the Christian Empire."

[We wrote a letter in 1993 to Pope John Paul II, calling upon him to formally revoke the Inter Cetera bull of 1493](ricb.md), and to thereby explicitly overturn the Church's doctrine of conquest and subjugation. Thus far, we have received only a stony silence from the Vatican.

Not only is the revocation of the Inter Cetera bull the right thing to do, it also would be an heroic moral act that would assist us to challenge and overturn the doctrine of domination that underlies U.S. Indian law.
